The BMI
========================================================
transition: fade
The BMI, Body Mass Index, is a measure of relative 
weight based on an individual's mass and height.
This is the formula with the international standard
of using kilograms for weight and meters for height:


```r
weigh/height^2
```

BMI Categories
========================================================

The World Health Organization (WHO) categorizes 
the BMI ranges as such:

<table style='margin: 1em 0;

border-collapse: collapse;

<tbody><tr>
<th>BMI range - kg/m<sup>2</sup></th>
<th>Category</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>less than 15</td>
<td>Very severely underweight</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>from 15.0 to 16.0</td>
<td>Severely underweight</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>from 16.0 to 18.5</td>
<td>Underweight</td>
